            <h2>About Riva (Rivasis Mehatusis)</h2>
            <p>Riva's love of the life is food, sleep and netflix. Her only stable relationship till now has been with netflix. Her ex loved her 'fashion scene'. Issok, her choices aren't great. Choosing me as a friend is an exception. She thinks she is funny, but she is not. She is delusional about her jokes which are very very lame. For being her friend, she owes me $30000, but it's okay, I forgive the debt. Riva loves Mumbai and she loves drama - not in her life but in other's life so that she is entertained always.</p>
